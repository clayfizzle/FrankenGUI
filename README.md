FrankenGUI
==========

hacked together GUI pieces in JMonkey 3 (JME3) that I am too 
ashamed to commit to the real RTS2013 repository, so they live here.


===========
So, the JMETest folder contains all the base material i've been scavanging from.
The others are mine and don't compile for various reasons with the execption of:

MapLoadTester,
SandBox2.


That's it.

* Usually it hase something to do with some jackass way they've decided to 
* nestle the scope of asset importing to make things really hard to just yank apart.  

* they are great examples though.
